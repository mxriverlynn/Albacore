<h2>About Albacore</h2>
<p>
	Albacore is a suite of <a href="http://rake.rubyforge.org">rake</a> tasks that is intended to make <a href="http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/derickbailey/archive/2009/09/29/albacore-assemblyinfo-task-vs-nant-assembly-info-generator.aspx">building .NET systems easier</a>. It originally <a href="http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/derickbailey/archive/2009/09/17/how-a-net-developer-hacked-out-a-rake-task.aspx">started as an experiment</a> to learn ruby and rake. After some basic ideas were laid down, the framework <a href="http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/derickbailey/archive/2009/09/23/albacore-a-suite-of-rake-build-tasks-for-net-solutions.aspx">took shape</a> pretty quickly. A number of people heard about it and began submitting their own patches and ideas to the project. After several iterations of the code, a lot of learning and a ton of great help, Albacore has become quite popular. It's getting some good press via <a href="http://stevenharman.net/blog/archive/2009/11/23/omg-better-rake-for-.net.aspx">blogs</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/#search?q=%23albacore">twitter</a>, and is continuing to grow and improve, rapidly.
